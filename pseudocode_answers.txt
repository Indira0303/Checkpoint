SHORT ANSWER
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to develop algorithm of actions before writing a code like breaking down a problem into little steps in a right sequence to write a correct code. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing will happen because pseudocode is used by programmers only and can be read only by human, computer will not recognize it.
Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
FUNCTION with arguments a and b 
IF the number a is greater than b THEN 
Print a
ELSE IF the number b is greater than a THEN
Print b
End IF

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR i equals to 1
  i is less than 100
  Increment i++
Print i

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

VAR equals to array of all entries in phonebook
FUNCTION with argument "entry"
FOR i equals to 0
  i less than array.length 
  Increment i++
IF entry with index i equals to function’s argument
Return true
Otherwise RETURN False

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

Var entry = [a, b, c, d, e]
function entrySearch (entry) {
 for (let i = 0, i < entry.length, i++){
  if (entry[i] === entry) {
 return true;
}
}
 return false;
}
